## What is ricing?
Short answer is ["make it look good"](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/).

## The challenge about this rice
This is not my first rice. Take a look at my [previous rice](https://github.com/CSaratakij/i3wm-desktop-config). \
The thing that need is __patience__.

Since install [arch linux](https://archlinux.org/) is not complicate for me at all. \
What is left is patiently read the man page of the stuff I want to use, and config as desire.

Took me about 3 days from install bare minimum arch linux to finish all the config from scratch.
