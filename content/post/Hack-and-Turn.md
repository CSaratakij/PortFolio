## Showcase

## Technical Challenge
Well, the challenge is about implementing 2 game genre in the same game with limit time. \
I only have 72 hours to complete.

The one that play hack & slash using overlap check for the slash area. \
And the one that play turn base is just a unity gui (UGUI).

## Summary
Another success jam for me. \
Didn't get sleep, but I'm happy with what is turn out.
