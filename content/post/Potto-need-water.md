## Showcase

## Introduction
This is my 3rd global game jam, Event is really fun. \
Having two programmers make things easier, I focus on the AI of the Potto (flower pot).

## Technical Challenge
Coming up with an interesting AI behaviour in a shot time is challenge.\
Although, writing code itself is not an issue (Simple state machine get
the job done).

Trying to focus on coding via freezing cold is stupidly challenge. \
(Cause by jam site's air conditioner..)

Jacket didn't help me at all...

## Summary
Another fun jam. \
The Potto AI is hilarious, exceed my own expection...
