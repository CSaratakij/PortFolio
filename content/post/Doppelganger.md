## Introduction
Before you read any further, I have to warn you. There are some __spoiler__ of the puzzle in this game. Please play the game first to avoid any spoiler.

This game is the entry for __The Twentieth National Software Contest: NSC 2018__.
We have about __3 months__ to finish this project.

We manage to get the __2nd runner up__ in ___"Program for entertainment"___ .

Since I mainly do a game system and some of the game design, I will cover these topics with in depth. However, I will leave the art aspect to the 
artist himself.

## Why this game call "Doppelganger"
If you already play the game, you will notice that there isn't a single doppelganger in this game.
We name this game __"Doppelganger"__ at first because we want the game to do something about a clone of our player character.

Turns out, none of the things we discuss in the early stage made it into the final product.
Most of the things in the game come from a first month we made doing a rappid prototype and play testing a lot.

But this is the entry for the contest, We cannot change our name mid-way due to the proposal we sent during the first round of the competition. So we kinda have to live with that.
